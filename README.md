üìñ Overview
This capstone project involved designing and deploying a fully functional, isolated IoT security lab to research attack vectors against smart city infrastructure. The environment integrated physical Libelium sensors with a security monitoring stack to capture, analyze, and visualize malicious activity in real-time, providing a practical framework for understanding IoT threat mitigation.

üéØ Key Objectives
To architect a realistic smart city IoT testbed for security research.

To simulate common wireless and network-based attacks against IoT protocols.

To establish a pipeline for ingesting, storing, and visualizing IoT telemetry and attack data.

To analyze the effectiveness of security monitoring and detection strategies.
